  <strong><em>Today's Joke:</em></strong><br />
  <div><strong>Three Men in the Desert</strong></div>
  <p>A judge was punishing three men because they had committed a crime. Their sentence was a few years in the desert. He said that they could each take one thing with them. </p>

  <ul>
	<li>The first guy decides to take an <span id="ul">umbrella</span>, so that he can have shade whenever he wants.</li>
	<li>The second guy decides to take a <em>water bottle</em> so that he won't get thirsty.</li>
	<li>Finally, the third guy decides to take a <span id="big">car door</span>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The judge asked, "Why in the world would you want to take a car door?"</p>
  <p>The man replies, "Well, in case it gets hot, I can roll down the window."</p>
  <p><span id="ps">Postscript:  Did the guy with the water bottle ask for water to be in it?  You be the judge.</span></p>
