                            more sensitive to obstacles that might stand in the way. Doing
                            this means looking not only at user's goals, but at their behaviors,
                            preferences and resources.</p>

                        <p>Take the example of a typical shopping site. A developer signs
                            on to help a record store set up a web storefront. </p>
                        <p>In the early stages of discussion, the developer quizzes the client
                            on their &quot;mission and goals&quot;, their needs, and their
                            concerns. In service to the client, the developer then spends three
                            months creating a website that will meet every one of these needs
                            and then some. The client is thrilled at the result. </p>

                        <p>When the website premieres, however, the client receives a flurry
                            of email from disgruntled consumers. From server logs, the developer
                            can tell that customers are not making it very far into the website.
                            Sales are particularly nonexistent. Six months later, the client
                            abandons the web storefront, convinced tht web shopping is a terrible
                            farce.</p>
                        <p>What happened? No one stopped to consider the <i>&quot;users'
                            goals&quot;</i>, and how they might be different from those of
                            the <i>company</i>.</p>
                        <p>The seller and the buyer can sometimes have radically different
                            goals. The following chart shows the different goals that <i>might</i> be
                            held by a record store and a user.</p>

                            driving process in this website's development from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>Navigation is &quot;goal-centered&quot; and &quot;action-oriented&quot;.
                            It occurs within a space, though it may not be a &quot;real&quot; physical
                            space. Understanding these key concepts is the first step in understanding
                            navigation design. Rather than designing sidebars and menus, you're
                            designing spaces and interactions. You're crafting the<b> User
                            Experience.</b></p>

                        <p>To understand these &quot;user goals&quot; and design accordingly,
                            you can start with these two methods: creating <b>&quot;Profiles&quot; </b>and
                            thinking in<b> &quot;Scenarios&quot;</b></p></td>
