<p> And now . . . here's the recipe that you have been waiting for!</p>

<p><strong>Mateo's Bath Bombs</strong></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1/4 C baking soda</li>
  <li>2 T citric acid (called "sour salt" in the kosher food aisle)</li>
  <li>1 T borax</li>
  <li>2 T Powdered sugar</li>
  <li>2 T almond oil or olive oil</li>
  <li>1 t vitamin E (for skin so soft)</li>
  <li>1/4 t essential oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Combine dry ingredients.</li>
  <li>Drizzle almond oil previously mixed with vitamin E and fragrance and mix well.</li>
  <li>Take teaspoon sized globs and form into balls with your fingers (Mixture is very crumbly, so do the best you can).</li>
  <li>Place these on wax paper and let harden 2 or 3 hours, then reshape again.</li>
  <li>Let dry completely, about 10 days, then store in an airtight container.</li>
</ol>
<p>To use, drop 1 or 2 into the bath and enjoy.  Mateo likes to press this mixture into little candy molds.  Increase about 4 times to make a man-sized batch.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
