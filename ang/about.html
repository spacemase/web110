1989-1990 Radium Removal Technician and Safety Inspector, Global Associates, Naval Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, WA. Removed low-level radioactive sources from decommissioned ships; mostly the electronic dials painted with radium paint. I've seen clocks in antique stores that have the same design from the same era. If you have a clock or compass from the late thirties to the early sixties that has paint on the dial that does not now glow, but maybe did then: it may have been fluorescent paint mixed with radium. The fluoresence is degraded by the ionizing radiation, but the radioactive byproducts persist, and may be quite "hot" with apha, beta, and gamma emitters in the paint and surrounding dust. Like so many others, this technology seemed like a good idea at the time.
