  <h1>A Natural Gardener</h1>
<pre>
A Natural Gardener is beyond organic. We view landscaping as a combination of art and science and as an expression of the relationship between a person and the world around them; using the principles of applied ecology and sustainable landscaping to bring harmony to the union of person and place.

We serve the Puget Sound region by planning, planting and pruning landscapes, enhancing ecological health and natural beauty.

Mike is an ISA Certified Arborist, offering tree health and hazard evaluations, educational consultations about natural land care, and the fine pruning of specimen trees and fruit trees, vines and shrubs.

We provide natural area consulting and services which focus on achieving sustainable, naturalistic, and ecologically healthy landscapes which tend to thrive and improve over time, with reducing inputs of materials and labor and reducing outputs of waste.

We work in the state of Washington, in the region of the Puget Sound including and surrounding Seattle.

We serve the Puget Sound region by designing, building, planting, and grooming landscapes in naturalistic or formal styles using natural processes and materials. Established 1995.
